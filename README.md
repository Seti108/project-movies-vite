# Movie Site Project

Web app to show omvies from an API focusing on React Routing.

Developers: Joona M & Sebastian Tigerschi√∂ld

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

We started with a mockup in Figma and then planned our components and routes. We then went ahead and built the app without and CSS.

This was done in pair programming sessions.

Once it was all working we split into branches and styled the app according to our Figma design.

We then merged and pair programmed the last details before handing in the project.
